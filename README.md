<h1> Educational Platform API</h1>

Description:
The Educational Platform API is a RESTful web service designed to support the functionality of an innovative online education platform. It provides endpoints for managing subjects, quizzes, enrollments, and other key features of the platform.

Features:

Subject Management: Allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete subjects. Each subject includes attributes such as name, level, description, price per hour, and associated teacher.

Quiz Management: Enables users to create, retrieve, update, and delete quizzes. Quizzes are associated with subjects and contain questions, options, and correct answers.

Enrollment Management: Facilitates the enrollment of students in subjects. Users can retrieve enrollments for a specific subject or student, as well as create and delete enrollments.

User Authentication: Provides endpoints for user authentication and authorization. Users can register, login, and logout securely using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Error Handling: Implements robust error handling to provide informative error messages and handle exceptions gracefully.

Input Validation: Validates user input to ensure data integrity and prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Documentation: Includes comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI to facilitate API exploration and usage.

Security: Implements security best practices such as HTTPS encryption, input validation, authentication, and authorization to protect sensitive data and ensure user privacy.

Scalability: Designed with scalability in mind to handle a large number of concurrent users and accommodate future growth and expansion of the educational platform.
